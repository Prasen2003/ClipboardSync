  "IoT Gesture System (Ultrasonic Sensors)  Developed a gesture-based control system using Arduino ultrasonic sensors and Python.  Implemented real-time distance sensing with noise handling and timeout safety.  Built a Tkinter GUI to simulate keyboard inputs (e.g., media control, custom inputs).  Enabled customizable key bindings, sensor toggles, and profile switching.  Used moving average filtering and serial communication for smooth, accurate gesture detection.
